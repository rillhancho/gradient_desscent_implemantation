# Gradient Descent Implementation in Python

# Overview

This project implements a simple gradient descent algorithm in Python using NumPy. The algorithm is designed to minimize the cost function for a given set of data points.

# Features

1. Uses a linear model (y = mx + b) to predict values.

2. Computes the cost function using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

3. Updates m and b using gradient descent.

4. Prints intermediate values of m, b, iteration count, and cost function.

# Requirements

Ensure you have Python installed along with NumPy:

pip install numpy

In this example, we used dummy data but you can use any dataset after modification.

# Modifications

1. Learning Rate (learning_rate): Adjust to control step size and convergence speed.

2. Iterations (iterations): Increase for better optimization.

3. Data Points (x, y): Modify to test with different datasets.

# Output

The function prints the updated values of m, b, the iteration count, and the cost after each iteration.

# Limitations

The learning rate is small; larger values may improve convergence but could also cause instability.

The number of iterations is limited; it may require tuning for better results.

This project is open-source and available for modification and improvement.
